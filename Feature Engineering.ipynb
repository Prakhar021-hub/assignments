    "Correlation refers to a statistical relationship between two variables, where they move together in some way, but one does not necessarily cause the other.\n",
    "Example of correlation: Ice cream sales and drowning incidents might both increase in summer. They are correlated because both increase in warmer weather, but ice cream sales don't cause drowning."

    "Gradient Descent (GD) It updates the model’s parameters by calculating the gradient (derivative) of the loss function with respect to the parameters, then moves the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient.
