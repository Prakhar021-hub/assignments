    "# Question 1: Explain the properties of the F-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **F-distribution** is a continuous probability distribution that arises frequently as the ratio of two scaled chi-square distributions. Key properties include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is **asymmetric and right-skewed**.  \n",
    "- Defined by two degrees of freedom parameters: \\(d_1\\) (numerator) and \\(d_2\\) (denominator).  \n",
    "- Values are always **non-negative** (â‰¥ 0).  \n",
    "- Used to compare variances by examining the ratio of two sample variances.  \n",
    "- The mean of the F-distribution is \\(\\frac{d_2}{d_2 - 2}\\) for \\(d_2 > 2\\).  \n",
    "- It approaches a normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2: In which types of statistical tests is the F-distribution used, and why is it appropriate for these tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-distribution is primarily used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F-tests** to compare variances of two populations.  \n",
    "- **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** to test differences between group means by comparing between-group variance to within-group variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is appropriate because the F-distribution models the ratio of two independent sample variances, which follow scaled chi-square distributions under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3: What are the key assumptions required for conducting an F-test to compare the variances of two populations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Key assumptions for the F-test include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Samples are independent.  \n",
    "- Populations are normally distributed.  \n",
    "- Samples come from populations with continuous distributions.  \n",
    "- The data are measured on at least an interval scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 4: What is the purpose of ANOVA, and how does it differ from a t-test?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose of ANOVA:** To determine if there are statistically significant differences among the means of three or more groups.  \n",
    "- **Difference from t-test:**  \n",
    "  - A t-test compares means between two groups only.  \n",
    "  - ANOVA can compare multiple groups simultaneously without increasing Type I error, which would happen if multiple t-tests were conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 5: Explain when and why you would use a one-way ANOVA instead of multiple t-tests when comparing more than two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-way ANOVA is used when comparing the means of **three or more independent groups** to test if at least one group mean differs significantly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using multiple t-tests increases the chance of Type I error (false positives). ANOVA controls the overall error rate while testing all groups simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 6: Explain how variance is partitioned in ANOVA into between-group variance and within-group variance. How does this partitioning contribute to the calculation of the F-statistic?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Between-group variance:** Variability due to differences between the group means and the overall mean.  \n",
    "- **Within-group variance:** Variability within each group around their respective means (random error).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **F-statistic** is the ratio:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "F = \\frac{\\text{Between-group variance}}{\\text{Within-group variance}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "A larger F-value indicates that between-group differences are large relative to within-group variation, suggesting significant group differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 7: Compare the classical (frequentist) approach to ANOVA with the Bayesian approach. What are the key differences in terms of how they handle uncertainty, parameter estimation, and hypothesis testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Frequentist ANOVA:**  \n",
    "  - Relies on sampling distributions and p-values.  \n",
    "  - Hypothesis testing focuses on rejecting or failing to reject null hypotheses.  \n",
    "  - Parameters are fixed but unknown quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bayesian ANOVA:**  \n",
    "  - Incorporates prior beliefs about parameters, updating these with data to get posterior distributions.  \n",
    "  - Provides probabilistic interpretations of parameters and model comparisons.  \n",
    "  - Handles uncertainty explicitly through the posterior distribution.\n",
