    "# 1. What is hypothesis testing in statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions about a population parameter based on sample data. It involves formulating a hypothesis and then using sample data to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null hypothesis (H₀):** A statement that there is no effect or no difference; it represents the default or status quo.  \n",
    "- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁ or Ha):** A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis; it indicates the presence of an effect or difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What is the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance level (denoted \\(\\alpha\\)) is the threshold probability for rejecting the null hypothesis. It represents the maximum allowable probability of making a Type I error (false positive). Common values are 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. What does a P-value represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is the probability of observing the test statistic or something more extreme assuming the null hypothesis is true. It quantifies the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. How do you interpret the P-value in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the p-value ≤ significance level \\(\\alpha\\), reject the null hypothesis (evidence suggests an effect).  \n",
    "- If the p-value > \\(\\alpha\\), fail to reject the null hypothesis (insufficient evidence).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. What are Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type I error:** Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (false positive).  \n",
    "- **Type II error:** Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false (false negative).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. What is the difference between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-tailed test:** Tests for an effect in one specific direction (greater than or less than).  \n",
    "- **Two-tailed test:** Tests for an effect in either direction (difference without specifying direction).\n",

    "\n",
    "# 8. What is the Z-test, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between sample and population means (or between two sample means) when the population variance is known and the sample size is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. How do you calculate the Z-score, and what does it represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-score is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "Z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",

    "# 10. What is the T-distribution, and when should it be used instead of the normal distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "The T-distribution is similar to the normal distribution but has heavier tails. It is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small.\n",

    "# 12. What is the T-test, and how is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",

    "The T-test compares means between two groups when population variance is unknown. It assesses whether the difference between sample means is statistically significant.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13. What is the relationship between Z-test and T-test in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The T-test approaches the Z-test as sample size increases because the sample standard deviation becomes a better estimate of the population standard deviation.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14. What is a confidence interval, and how is it used to interpret statistical results?\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval gives a range of values within which the true population parameter is expected to lie with a specified probability (confidence level, e.g., 95%).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15. What is the margin of error, and how does it affect the confidence interval?\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error quantifies the maximum expected difference between the sample estimate and the true population parameter. A larger margin of error widens the confidence interval.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 16. How is Bayes' Theorem used in statistics, and what is its significance?\n",
    "\n",

    "# 20. What is an ANOVA test, and what are its assumptions?\n",
