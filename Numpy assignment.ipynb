    "Performance Optimization\n",
    "NumPy is optimized for performing operations on arrays with fixed-size data types. Operations on smaller or simpler data types (e.g., int32 vs. int64) can be faster because they involve fewer CPU cycles and use less memory bandwidth.Using fixed data types allows NumPy to optimize operations through vectorization and efficient memory usage, which significantly boosts performance."
